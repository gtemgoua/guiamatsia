## It was

On the 11th of September 1976, *Joseph and Marie Therese Guiamatsia* got married in a church in west Cameroon. Soon after they were blessed with two children:

* A boy-Louis
* A girl-Irene.

Louis and Irene were born in the Eastern Province of Cameroon and soon after moved to yaounde to start their education. Many years later they will move to Canada to further their education in different fields of engineering. Louis will graduate in Software Engineering while Irene will become a Mechanical Engineer.

Soon after their graduation, Joseph and Marie Therese decided to retire and take a well deserved rest.

Nowadays the Guiamatsia family is much bigger. We are blessed to have younger brothers such as Xavier and Arno as well as older brothers and sisters.

Follow the pages on this website to know more about our family. Each person has a wonderful story to tell.
